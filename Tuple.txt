# Tuple
    1. It is a sequence data type (Ordered data type)
    2. It is an immutable data type
    3. a) Representation ()
       b) Comma separated
    4. It is faster than a list
    5. Single Element Representation
    6. Generally, whenever data is fetched from a database, it is stored in the form of a Tuple or dictionary. 

    # Stack and Heap Memory Allocation
    # In Python, memory is managed by the Python Memory Manager. It divides the memory into two areas: Stack and Heap.
    # Stack:
    #   - It is a region of memory that stores data in a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) order.
    #   - It is used to store primitive data types such as integers, floats, and characters.
    #   - The stack is used for static memory allocation.
    #   - It is faster and more efficient than the heap.
    # Heap:
    #   - It is a region of memory that stores data in a random order.
    #   - It is used to store complex data types such as lists, dictionaries, and objects.
    #   - The heap is used for dynamic memory allocation.
    #   - It is slower and less efficient than the stack due to the overhead of dynamic allocation.
    #   - Garbage collection is used to manage the heap and free up unused memory.
