# 2. Data Science and Machine Learning
# 3. Artificial Intelligence
# 4. Scientific Computing
# 5. Automation and Scripting
        - Automation: 
        Python is great for creating programs that do repetitive tasks automatically. 
        This means you can write a script to do boring or time-consuming jobs for you, saving you time and effort. 
        For example, you could use Python to automatically organize files, send emails, 
        or update databases without having to do these tasks manually.

#Introduction to Python

# Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability.

# It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991..
# Python's first public release was in 1991, not 1994.
# The initial release (version 0.9.0) was made available to the public in February 1991.
# Version 1.0 was released in January 1994, which might be the source of confusion.

python_public_release = 1991
print(f"Python was first released to the public in {python_public_release}.")


# Python is widely used for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more.
========================================================================================================================

# Why is Python named "Python"?

# The name "Python" doesn't come from the snake, as many might assume.
# It was chosen by Guido van Rossum, Python's creator, as a tribute to the British comedy group Monty Python.

# Guido was reading the published scripts from "Monty Python's Flying Circus" when he began implementing Python.
# He wanted a name that was short, unique, and slightly mysterious, so he chose "Python".

print("Fun fact: Python is named after the comedy group 'Monty Python', not the snake!")

# This naming choice reflects the language's philosophy of being fun to use.
# It also aligns with Python's tradition of using silly terms for some of its features, like "spam" and "eggs" in examples.

# Features of Python

# 1. Easy to learn and use
# 2. Extensive standard library
# 3. Support for multiple programming paradigms
# 4. Dynamic typing and automatic memory management
# 5. Cross-platform compatibility
# 6. Its is High Level Language
# 7. It is Object-Oriented Language
# 8. It is Interpreted Language

    Translator:
    Python is a translator between human and computer language.
    # 1. Complier
        - Complier translates the entire program at once.
    # 2. Interpreter
        - Interpreter translates the program line by line.

# Explanation of the Python Interpreter process
print("""
Explanation of the Python Interpreter process:

1. Python Source Code: The process starts with the Python source code written by the programmer.

2. Lexical Analysis: The source code is broken down into tokens (smallest units of meaning).

3. Syntax Analysis: The tokens are analyzed to ensure they follow Python's grammar rules.

4. Semantic Analysis: The code's meaning is checked for logical errors.

5. Bytecode Generation: The code is compiled into bytecode, a low-level representation.

6. Python Virtual Machine (PVM): The bytecode is sent to the PVM for execution.

7. Execution: The PVM executes the bytecode, producing the program's output.

This process allows Python to be both interpreted and compiled, contributing to its flexibility and ease of use.

# Platform Dependent

# Platform Dependent means that the program will behave differently on different platforms.
# For example, a program that reads a file from the user's computer will behave differently on Windows and Linux.

# Platform Independent

# Platform Independent means that the program will behave the same on all platforms.
# For example, a program that reads a file from the user's computer will behave the same on Windows and Linux.

# Python is Platform Independent because it is an interpreted language.
# The interpreter in Python is a program that reads the source code and executes it directly.
# This means that the source code can be run on any platform without any modification.


=====================================================================================================================================

# Sequence :
    # Ordered Data Type
    #1. List
    #2. Tuple
    #3. String

To maintain order of data type we use indexing 


In Python when we want to store multiple elements with the help of single Referce (vairable), Then we have two options
#1. List 
#2. Tuple

    List is a container in which we contain hydrogenius data as we as Homogeunius  { Array is not a buil-in support in Python}
    
    # List Manipulation
    List is a mutable data type

    #Empty List
    1. lis=[]
    2. li = list()

#Slicing
    #Slicing is used to get a slice (subsequence )of a sequence datatype

    # List, set , and dictionary 

#String:
    1. Sequence (Ordered)
    2. Imutable
