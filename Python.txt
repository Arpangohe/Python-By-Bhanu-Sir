# Applications :
# 1. Web Development
# 2. Data Science and Machine Learning
# 3. Artificial Intelligence
# 4. Scientific Computing
# 5. Automation and Scripting
        - Automation: 
        Python is great for creating programs that do repetitive tasks automatically. 
        This means you can write a script to do boring or time-consuming jobs for you, saving you time and effort. 
        For example, you could use Python to automatically organize files, send emails, 
        or update databases without having to do these tasks manually.

#Introduction to Python

# Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability.

# It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991..
# Python's first public release was in 1991, not 1994.
# The initial release (version 0.9.0) was made available to the public in February 1991.
# Version 1.0 was released in January 1994, which might be the source of confusion.

python_public_release = 1991
print(f"Python was first released to the public in {python_public_release}.")


# Python is widely used for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more.
========================================================================================================================

# Why is Python named "Python"?

# The name "Python" doesn't come from the snake, as many might assume.
# It was chosen by Guido van Rossum, Python's creator, as a tribute to the British comedy group Monty Python.

# Guido was reading the published scripts from "Monty Python's Flying Circus" when he began implementing Python.
# He wanted a name that was short, unique, and slightly mysterious, so he chose "Python".

print("Fun fact: Python is named after the comedy group 'Monty Python', not the snake!")

# This naming choice reflects the language's philosophy of being fun to use.
# It also aligns with Python's tradition of using silly terms for some of its features, like "spam" and "eggs" in examples.

# Features of Python

# 1. Easy to learn and use
# 2. Extensive standard library
# 3. Support for multiple programming paradigms
# 4. Dynamic typing and automatic memory management
# 5. Cross-platform compatibility
# 6. Its is High Level Language
# 7. It is Object-Oriented Language
# 8. It is Interpreted Language

    Translator:
    Python is a translator between human and computer language.
    # 1. Complier
        - Complier translates the entire program at once.
    # 2. Interpreter
        - Interpreter translates the program line by line.
